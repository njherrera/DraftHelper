# DraftHelper
Designed to help fantasy basketball players with their drafting process. 

The goal is to build a program that acts as a real-time draft board for fantasy basketball players, showing both the best players avaiable in the draft as well as the players that best fit the user's team.

Currently the plan is to support standard 9-category rotisserie leagues at first, but I also want to expand to other formats, especially H2H (Head To Head). H2H represents a unique challenge, as in that format the dominant strategy is "punting," picking 1-3 categories to excel at, and 1-2 to give up on.
