# DraftHelper
Designed to help fantasy basketball players with their drafting process. 

The project continually tracks available players in a fantasy basketball draft, ranking them based on user-supplied fantasy projections (at the moment, the program is written to use HashtagBasketball's projections). As players are selected by the user and other teams, the program recommends both the best available player based on overall fantasy impact, as well as players recommended based on the user's team composition (i.e. if user's team is poor at rebounding, recommend strong rebounders). 

At the moment the program only supports the "rotisserie" format, in which 9 categories (field goal %, free throw %, points, 3 pointers, steals, blocks, assists, rebounds, and turnovers) are weighted equally. In the future I plan on adding support for  "head to head," or "H2H" leagues, in which teams are matched up against each other each week and compared in (usually) the same categories, with the winner of the match being the team who won in the most categories. 

After completing a functional prototype of this project I've put development on the back burner while I pursue other projects, but I plan on having a finished version ready for the start of the next basketball season, at which point I'd like to make it publicly available.
